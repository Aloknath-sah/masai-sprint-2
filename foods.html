      <p class="items">Eggs</p>
      <p>
        Eggs are a very good source of inexpensive, high-quality protein. More
        than half the protein of an egg is found in the egg white, which also
        includes vitamin B2 and lower amounts of fat than the yolk. Eggs are
        rich sources of selenium, vitamin D, B6, B12 and minerals such as zinc,
        iron and copper. Egg yolks contain more calories and fat than the
        whites. They are a source of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K and
        lecithin, the compound that enables emulsification in recipes such as
        hollandaise or mayonnaise.

      <p>
        The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for one
        3-ounce (85g) serving of boneless, skinless grilled chicken breast.Note
        that many commercially packaged chicken breasts are much larger than 3
        ounces. So if you eat a single breast, youâ€™re probably eating more than
        a single serving.
